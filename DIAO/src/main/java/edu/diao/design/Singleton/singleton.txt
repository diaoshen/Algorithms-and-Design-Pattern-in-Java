Singleton Design Pattern


Generic Steps : 

	1. Create singleton class 
	2. make a private static singleton object
	3. make constrctor private , so can't call  doing  "singleton myObject"
	4. if singleton object doesn't exist
			synchronized(singleton.class) // To force sycn 
				//Other thread can still enter here before above statment was executed , so perform another check
				if singleton object doesn't exist 
					make singleton object
		else
			return original/current singleton object
