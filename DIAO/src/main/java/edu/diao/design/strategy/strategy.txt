Strategy Design Pattern

Generic Steps :
	1. Create abstract class A and extract any methods x that might be changed later into its own interface 
		1.1 create classes that will implement interface x 
		1.2 class A will contain return type of x 
	2. Create subclass that extends A 
	
	
	

Example : 

	1. Abstract class Character :   Extracted method kick and jump // that means these 2 method need to be interface
	2. Class Rugal , Mai , Ryu  will 
	3. Interface KickBehavior , JumpBehavior
	4. Class LongJump implements JumpBehavior     ,    Class ShortJump implements JumpBehavior
	5. Class TornadoKick implements KickBehavior  ,    Class LightningKick implements KickBehavior
